# SmartMirror
Smart mirrors are straight from science fiction. They're part of an optimistic vision of the future that imagines a world where screens and data are everywhere, ready to feed you whatever information you need at a momemt's notice. A smart mirror, also known as a magic mirror, displays the time, weather, calendar, news, and social media updates. The magic is created by placing a transparent mirror over a screen such as a tablet, monitor, or TV. The technology is driven by a Raspberry Pi or Windows PC, combined with voice and face recognition.
