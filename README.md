# SmartMirror
**Smart mirrors are straight from science fiction. They're part of an optimistic vision of the future that imagines a world where screens and data are everywhere, ready to feed you whatever information you need at a momemt's notice. A smart mirror, also known as a magic mirror, displays the time, weather, calendar, news, and social media updates. The magic is created by placing a transparent mirror over a screen such as a tablet, monitor, or TV. The technology is driven by a Raspberry Pi or Windows PC, combined with voice and face recognition.**

**Motivation : :muscle:**
- **As technology advances, we continue to find more uses for it that would previously be inconceivable.**
- **The primary motivation behind the smart mirror is to improve quality of life. The smart mirror will provide convenient information to users on their mirror everyday.**
- **Motivation for this project stems from multiple sources. In the IRON MAN films, the main character (JARVIS) utilizes holographic displays around the home.**
